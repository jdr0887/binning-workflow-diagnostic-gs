      <p>The binning project is an OSGi based project distributed as a
      custom Karaf distribution.  As such, provisioning bundles, or
      collection of bundles, to an installation is available.  Each
      plugin has a 'features' module that details the dependent
      bundles for a binning workflow.</p>
      <subsection name="Installing a feature">
	<p>First thing to do is to ssh into the Karaf container.
	Something like 'ssh -p 8101 -l karaf localhost' should do the
	trick if you already have system level machine access &amp;
	the Karaf server is running.  Once in, you will have a prompt
	to execute a number of Karaf commands.  Here are a few
	commands to review the installation state:</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:list
karaf@root()> feature:repo-list</pre>
        <p>To add the diagnostic-gs feature repository:</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.renci.binning.workflows.diagnostic-gs/diagnostic-gs-features/&lt;version&gt;/xml/features</pre>
        <p>To remove the diagnostic-gs feature repository:</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:repo-remove mvn:org.renci.binning.workflows.diagnostic-gs/diagnostic-gs-features/&lt;version&gt;/xml/features</pre>
        <p>To install the diagnostic-gs feature:</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:install diagnostic-gs</pre>
        <p>To uninstall the diagnostic-gs feature:</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:uninstall diagnostic-gs</pre>
        <p>This paradigm allows for iterative development on binning plugins/workflows.</p>
	<pre>karaf@root()> feature:uninstall diagnostic-gs
karaf@root()> feature:repo-remove mvn:org.renci.binning.workflows.diagnostic-gs/diagnostic-gs-features/&lt;current-version&gt;/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:repo-add mvn:org.renci.binning.workflows.diagnostic-gs/diagnostic-gs-features/&lt;next-version&gt;/xml/features
karaf@root()> feature:install diagnostic-gs</pre>
